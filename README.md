## Upgrading from version 2.2 or Higher
Version 2.2 introduced the ability to upgrade pre-compiled firmware from a binary file.  In version 2.3 and on you should find binary files that can be uploaded to your printer monitor via the web interface.  From the main menu in the web interface select "Firmware Update" and follow the prompts.
* **printermonitor.ino.d1_mini_SSD1306.bin** - compiled for Wemos D1 Mini for the smaller 0.96" SSD1306 OLED (default)
* **printermonitor.ino.d1_mini_SH1106.bin** - compiled for Wemos D1 Mini for the larger 1.3" SH1106 OLED
* **printermonitor.ino.d1_mini_repetier_SSD1306.bin** - Repetier version compiled for Wemos D1 Mini for the smaller 0.96" SSD1306 OLED (default)
* **printermonitor.ino.d1_mini_repetier_SH1106.bin** - Repetier version compiled for Wemos D1 Mini for the larger 1.3" SH1106 OLED
* **printermonitor.ino.d1_mini_easyboard.bin** - Version compiled for Easy Monitor Board for the smaller 0.96" SSD1306 OLED (SDA -> D2 and SCL -> D1) 
* **printermonitor.ino.d1_mini_easyboard_repetier.bin** - Repetier version compiled for Easy Monitor Board for the smaller 0.96" SSD1306 OLED (SDA -> D2 and SCL -> D1)

## Compiling and Loading to Wemos D1 Mini
It is recommended to use Arduino IDE.  You will need to configure Arduino IDE to work with the Wemos board and USB port and installed the required USB drivers etc.  
* USB CH340G drivers:  https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html
* Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.  This will add support for the Wemos D1 Mini to Arduino IDE.
* Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 Core platform version 2.5.2
* Select Board:  "LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini"
* Set 1M SPIFFS -- this project uses SPIFFS for saving and reading configuration settings.

## Loading Supporting Library Files in Arduino
Use the Arduino guide for details on how to installing and manage libraries https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries  
**Packages** -- the following packages and libraries are used (download and install):  
ESP8266WiFi.h  
ESP8266WebServer.h  
WiFiManager.h --> https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager  
ESP8266mDNS.h  
ArduinoOTA.h  --> Arduino OTA Library  
"SSD1306Wire.h" --> https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306  
"OLEDDisplayUi.h"  

Note Printer-Monitor version 2.5 and later include ArduinoJson (version 5.13.1).   

## Initial Configuration
All settings may be managed from the Web Interface, however, you may update the **Settings.h** file manually -- but it is not required.  There is also an option to display current weather when the print is off-line.  
* If you are using the Easy Monitor Board you must set the const int SCL_PIN = D1 in the Settings.h file.
* By default OctoPrint client is selected.  If you wish to use Repetier then uncomment //#define USE_REPETIER_CLIENT in the Settings.h file.
* Your OctoPrint API Key from your OctoPrint -> User Settings -> Current API Key  -- similar for Repetier API Key.
* Optional OpenWeatherMap API Key -- if you want current weather when not printing.  Get the api key from: https://openweathermap.org/  

NOTE: The settings in the Settings.h are the default settings for the first loading. After loading you will manage changes to the settings via the Web Interface. If you want to change settings again in the settings.h, you will need to erase the file system on the Wemos or use the “Reset Settings” option in the Web Interface.  

## Web Interface
The Printer Monitor uses the **WiFiManager** so when it can't find the last network it was connected to 
it will become a **AP Hotspot** -- connect to it with your phone and you can then enter your WiFi connection information.

After connected to your WiFi network it will display the IP addressed assigned to it and that can be 
used to open a browser to the Web Interface.  **Everything** can be configured there.
